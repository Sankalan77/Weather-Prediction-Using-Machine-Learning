🌤️ **_Jalpaiguri Weather Prediction_**

📘 **_Overview_**

This project focuses on **predicting the weather conditions of Jalpaiguri district** using data-driven machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze historical weather data, identify important meteorological parameters, and build a model capable of forecasting future weather trends such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall probability.

🎯 **_Objectives_**

•	To clean, preprocess, and visualize historical weather data for Jalpaiguri.<br>
•	To explore relationships between climatic features such as temperature, humidity, pressure, and precipitation.<br>
•	To develop a predictive model for short-term and long-term weather forecasting.<br>
•	To evaluate and compare model performance using accuracy metrics.

🧠 **_Technologies & Tools Used_**

•	Programming Language: Python<br>
•	Environment: Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)<br>
•	Libraries:
1. **pandas, numpy** – Data cleaning & preprocessing<br>
2. **matplotlib, seaborn** – Data visualization<br>
3. **scikit-learn** – Model training and evaluation<br>
4. **statsmodels / xgboost** – Advanced modeling techniques

⚙️ **_Workflow_**

**1. Data Loading**: Load the Jalpaiguri weather dataset (CSV file).<br>
**2. Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, outliers, and type conversions.<br>
**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize temperature trends, humidity variation, rainfall patterns, etc.<br>
**4. Feature Engineering**: Select and scale features relevant to prediction.<br>
**5. Model Training**: Train different machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Decision Tree).<br>
**6. Model Evaluation**: Compare model performance based on metrics like R² score, MAE, and RMSE.<br>
**7. Prediction**: Generate future weather predictions for Jalpaiguri.

📊 **_Results_**

The trained models provided reliable predictions for key weather parameters such as temperature and humidity. Among all tested algorithms, the **Random Forest model** achieved the highest accuracy, showing strong consistency with real-world weather patterns. The visualizations effectively highlighted seasonal variations and feature correlations.
